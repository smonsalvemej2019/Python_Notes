#Syntaxes

#None...Python has not syntax. Well it does, but remember that you do not have to 
#define your data type

#Basic datatypes

num = 1 #this is an integer
fnumber = 2.8 #this is a decimal
letter = 'a' #this is a character 
strng = "Hello Painful world" #this is a string

#I/O. 
#like any other language there is basic i/o 

myInput = input("Enter a number of your choice: ")
print('This is my output:', myInput)
